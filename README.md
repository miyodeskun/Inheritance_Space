Tittle: Space

In space, it is filled with emptiness, areas where nothing at all is present and galaxies are 
filled with empty space along with the other elements found in galaxies. There are different 
types of galaxies which are Spiral, Elliptical & Irregular. Among these 3 stars, there had a 
few similarities; 

1. The size is huge
2. Contains dust, stars and gas
3. Held together by gravity

The presence of the bulge in the galaxies only in the Spiral Galaxy. Their shape also different

Spiral : Pinwheel shape
Elliptical : Round-to-oval shape

Based on this example, galaxy as the object of the system (OOP). Whereas the galaxy has it value

the same attributes such as size, contents and characteristics.
